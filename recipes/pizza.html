    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Pizza is a popular Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, olives, vegetables, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
